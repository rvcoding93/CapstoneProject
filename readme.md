AI UKRANIAN REFUGEE FINDER APP NAME: "OVER HERE"
=================================================
THE PURPOSE OF THIS APP WAS TO CREATE A NEW APPLICATION UTILIZING AI FACIAL RECOGNITION.
Facebook,IG, social media in general are great apps for relocating with people who are 
already connected but if you have no info or access to their accounts for whatever reason,
OVER HERE gives you the opportunity to reconnect following an example scenario described below:

example: 

- User 1, lost their sister during an emergency evacuation. They went west to Germany.
- User 2 (the sister) went north to Poland.
- User 1 downloads OVER HERE and submits 5 photos of User 2. 
    *User 1 adds their standard sign up contact info prior to use
    *User 1 recieves notice of a 65% match and a 82% match. Neither of these are User 2. 
          So User 1 recieves a notice stating NO MATCHES FOUND.
- User 2 follows the same steps.
    *  Upon user 2 submitting photos of user 1, OVER HERE searches its database for related photos. 
        once the match is found from the photos submitted by user 1, User 2 gets a notice of a 95% match.
        User 2 confirms YES that is my sister! 
- Once User 2 CONFIRMS User 1 is a match, User 1 recieves notice of the potential match. (similar to dating apps)
-User 1 then has the option to confirm YES this is my sister.
- Once User 1 confirms, as User 2 has already confirmed, the contact information submitted by both users during signup
is sent to both parties. 
    *possible bonus feature, adding a video chat / calling feature for immediate push and go contact. (Premium feature?)
